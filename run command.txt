I have created a permanent solution for you. I've configured a VS Code task that will run your Streamlit application correctly every time.

Now, you can simply press Ctrl+Shift+B (or Cmd+Shift+B on Mac) to run the default build task, which I have set to launch your Streamlit app.

I have also started the application for you. You can view it at http://localhost:8501.
